# browser-text-editor

This is a text editor that can run in the browser.

I made this in high school because I needed something to edit plaintext on the chromebooks the school gave us. We couldn't install our own apps, and I didn't want to rely on a website to edit files, so I made my own editor.

## Features

* Supports editing multiple files
* Content Type option includes a list of default types that also update the file extension
* Resizable textarea field for file content
* Can open existing files
* Preserves list of old saves for each file
* Includes access keys as keyboard shortcuts

## Access keys

* `1-9`: switch to tab 1-9
* `n`: make new tab
* `m`: change file name
* `c`: change content type
* `s`: save file
* `o`: open file
* `r`: recover old saves
* `e`: edit file
